# Mapsies
Map IP to geographical location:

I needed an easier way to associate malicious IP addresses with their geographic location. I wrote this to simplify mapping log activity to a geographical location. It can be added to a cronjob and somewhat 'automated'.

Requires:
Installation of https://github.com/pieqq/PyGeoIpMap + DB/Map local to host.
